/*
 * A PriorityQueue is used when the objects are supposed to be processed based on the 
 * priority. 
 * It is known that a Queue follows the First-In-First-Out algorithm, but sometimes 
 * the elements of the 
 * queue are needed to be processed according to the priority, thatâ€™s when the 
 * PriorityQueue comes into play. 
 * The PriorityQueue is based on the priority heap. The elements of the priority 
 * queue are ordered according to 
 * the ""natural ordering(COMPARABLE)"", 
 * or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time, depending on which 
 * constructor is used.
