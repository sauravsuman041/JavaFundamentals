/*
 * Older approach to close the resources:::
 * 
This is an older approach that we used to handle file related operations.
Notice, we manually closed the resource using close() method.
 */
/*JDK 8 FEATURE::
 * a try with resources is a feature of Java which was added into Java 7. 
 * It helps to close all the resources declared within try block. 
 * It automatically closes the resources after being used. 
 * A resource can be any file or a database connection.
For example, if we are working with File handing then after opening a file, 
it requires to be closed after reading or writing data. 
In early versions of Java, we have to explicitly close the resource, 
but from Java 7, we donâ€™t need to worry about to close the resources.
