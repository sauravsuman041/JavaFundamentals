Synchronization::
--Synchronization is a process of controlling the access of shared resources
 by the multiple threads in such a manner that only one thread can access a 
 particular resource at a time.
--Once a thread enters a synchronized code, it acquires a mutex(lock). 
It is released only when the thread leaves the synchronized code.

--In non synchronized multithreaded application, it is possible for 
one thread to modify a shared object while another thread is 
in the process of using or updating the objectâ€™s value. 

--Synchronization prevents such type of data corruption which may otherwise
 lead to dirty reads and significant errors.

--A deadlock occurs when two or more threads wait for each other to
 release the lock on a particular object. Synchronization will prevent
  deadlock.

--Synchronized methods are also called thread-safe methods.
Generally critical sections of the code are usually marked with 
synchronized keyword.

--Only methods (or blocks) can be synchronized, 
Classes and variable cannot be synchronized.
      
--Each object has just one lock.
--All methods in a class need not to be synchronized. 
A class can have both synchronized and non-synchronized methods.
--Constructors cannot be synchronized

/*
--Uses of synchronization:
1.to prevent thread interruption
2.to prevent inconsistency problem
