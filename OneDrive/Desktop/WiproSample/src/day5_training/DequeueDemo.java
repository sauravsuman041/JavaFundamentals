/*
 * Deque is an acronym for “double-ended queue”. 
 * Java Deque Interface is a linear collection 
 * that supports 
 * element insertion and removal at both ends. The class which implements this interface is 
 * ArrayDeque. 
 * It extends the Queue interface. Deque is an interface and has two implementations: 
 * LinkedList and ArrayDeque.
 * 
 * Creating a Deque
Syntax : Deque dq = new LinkedList();
               Deque dq = new ArrayDeque();

/*
 * A queue is a simple data structure where the insertion and deletion of elements take place from the one end, 
 * whereas Deque is a hybrid data structure serving the purpose of both the stack and queue and 
 * insertion and deletion of elements can take place from both the ends according to the requirements of the user.
 * 
 * --Insertion and deletion of elements are more efficient as the 
 * resources are completely utilized in the case of the deque.
