/*
 * LinkedList::
 * --Ordered collection
 * --internally uses DOUBLY LINKED LIST(previous node+data+next node) 
 * to store the elements
 * --DML operations are very fast compared to arraylist
 * --class LinkedList implements List,""Queue(Interface)(Ticket counter)""

 * --Java LinkedList class allows storing duplicate elements.
 * --Insertion and removal of elements in the LinkedList are fast because, 
 * in the linked list, there is no shifting of elements after each adding and removal. 
 * The only reference for next and previous elements changed.
 --LinkedList is the best choice if your frequent operation is insertion or deletion in the middle.

 --Retrieval (getting) of elements is very slow in LinkedList because 
it traverses from the beginning or ending to reach the element.
--We can iterate linked list elements by using ListIterator.

 /*
 * What is best Case Scenario to Use LinkedList in Java application?

 * Java LinkedList is the best choice to use when your frequent operation is adding or removing elements in the 
 * middle of the list because the adding and
 *  removing of elements in the linked list is faster as compared to ArrayList.
 *  
 *  But in the case of linked list, if we remove 50th element from the linked list, no shifting of elements 
 *  will take place after removal. 
 *  Only the reference of the next and previous node will change.
 *  
 *  What is Worst Case Scenario to Use LinkedList?

Java LinkedList is the worst choice to use when your frequent operation is retrieval (getting) of elements 
from the 
linked list because retrieval of elements is very slow in the LinkedList as compared to ArrayList.
